# Express.js To-Do Application

This is a simple Express.js web application where users can sign up, log in, and manage a personal to-do list. The application demonstrates fundamental capabilities of Express.js, including user authentication, database management using Sequelize, and basic CRUD operations.

## Features

- User authentication using Passport.js
- SQLite database management with Sequelize ORM
- Responsive and visually appealing design using Bootstrap
- Basic CRUD operations for managing tasks
- Middleware for data input and validation
- Testing with Mocha and Chai

## Requirements

- Node.js 14+
- Express.js 4+
- SQLite (using Sequelize ORM)
- Bootstrap 5+

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulgupta1432/todo-application-full-stack.git
   cd todo-application-full-stack
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```env
SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=4000
DB_NAME=to-do-app
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_HOST=localhost
JWT_SECRET=do-to-list

   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm start
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to access the application.

Assignment Outline: Express.js To-Do Application 

  

Overview 

This assignment involves creating a simple Express.js web application where users can sign up, log in, and manage a personal to-do list. The application will demonstrate the fundamental capabilities of Express.js, including user authentication, database management, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 

  

  

Objectives 

Learn to set up an Express.js assignment and configure its environment. 

Implement user authentication using Passport.js. 

Create models to interact with the database effectively using Sequelize. 

Develop routes and views for user interaction. 

Utilize Express.js middleware for data input and validation. 

Use Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing design. 

  

  

Requirements 

Node.js 14+ 

Express.js 4+ 

SQLite (using Sequelize ORM) 

Bootstrap 5+ 

  

  

Assignment Tasks 

Setup and Assignment Configuration 

Install Express.js and create a new assignment named ToDoApp. 

Set up the initial configuration and directories. 

  

  

2.  User Authentication 

Implement the User model using Sequelize. 

Create registration and login routes using Passport.js. 

Develop views for user registration, login, and logout. 

Configure URL patterns for authentication route 

 

  

3.  To-Do List Model 

Design a Task model with fields such as title, description, completed, and createdAt. 

Set up model relationships to link tasks to specific users. 

Configure the admin panel to manage tasks. 

  

  

4.  Task Management Routes 

Create routes to handle CRUD operations for tasks: 

Display all tasks in the userâ€™s dashboard. 

Allow users to create new tasks. 

Enable editing and deleting existing tasks. 

Implement a route to toggle task completion. 

Ensure that users can only interact with tasks they own. 

  

  

5.  Templates and Forms 

Design views for the registration, login, and task dashboard. 

Use middleware for task creation and updates. 

Apply Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing design. 

  

  

6.  Testing and Debugging 

Write basic tests for the models and routes using Mocha and Chai. Debug and ensure all functionalities work as intended. 

  

7.  Documentation 

Document the setup process and how to run the application. Provide a user guide on how to use the application features. 

  

Evaluation Criteria 

Functionality: All features must work as described. 

Code Quality: Code should be clean, well-commented, and properly organized. 

User Interface: The application should be user-friendly and visually organi 

 

  

Submission Guidelines 

Submit the assignment as a zip file containing all source code, along with any necessary documentation. 

Include a README file with instructions on setting up and running the application. 

  

  

Additional Challenges (Optional) 

Implement AJAX to add and complete tasks without refreshing the page. 

Use Express.js Router and middleware for better structure. 

Add functionality for users to set deadlines for tasks.
